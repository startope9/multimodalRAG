OpenSearch, 
and 
classification 
proceeded 
via 
a 
k-nearest-neighbor majority-vote over the top ten neighbors, 
with cosine-similarity thresholds of 0.75 and 0.85 controlling 
assignment strictness. 
We evaluated our k-NN–based classifier on a test set of 2 500 
logs, using two cosine-similarity thresholds (0.75 and 0.85) to 
control how strictly a new log must match its nearest 
neighbors before being assigned a label. 
●​
Threshold = 0.75: Out of 2 500 logs, the system 
confidently assigned labels to 1 690 entries (67.6 % 
coverage). Of these, 1 600 were correctly tagged and 
90 were incorrect, yielding an accuracy of 94.7 % on 
the covered subset. The remaining 810 logs (32.4 %) 
failed to exceed the similarity cutoff and were 
marked as “unseen.” 
●​
Threshold = 0.85: With a more stringent cutoff, 
coverage fell to 1 150 labeled logs (46.0 %). Within 
this set, 1 100 predictions were correct and 50 
incorrect, for an accuracy of 95.7 % on the covered 
subset. Consequently, 1 350 logs (54.0 %) remained 
“unseen.” 
By 
adjusting 
the 
cosine‐similarity 
threshold, 
practitioners can dial in exactly how “strict” the system should 
be when assigning labels. A lower threshold (0.75) gives 
broader coverage—labeling more logs at slightly lower 
accuracy—while a higher threshold (0.85) yields very high 
precision but leaves a larger fraction unlabeled. This tunable 
trade‐off lets teams optimize for their operational priorities:
