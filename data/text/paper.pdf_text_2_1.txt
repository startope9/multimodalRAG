snippets for indexing sentence‐transformer embeddings and 
executing k‐NN queries, providing a practical foundation for 
researchers implementing log‐analysis prototypes that require 
semantic similarity search. 
In [14], CloudThat releases a technical blog on vector 
databases for efficient memory management, discussing how 
vector indices enable approximate search over large datasets 
with controlled accuracy‐latency trade‐offs. The post delves 
into memory‐optimization techniques such as quantization 
and inverted‐file filtering, which can reduce index size by up 
to 70% with minimal accuracy loss. These methods are 
directly applicable to log embeddings, where index bloat 
poses challenges for scaling to enterprise‐level log volumes, 
thus informing design decisions in our proposed framework. 
In [15], the lakeFS Blog explores “What Is a Vector Database? 
Top 12 Use Cases,” several of which—semantic search, 
similarity clustering, and anomaly detection—align with 
log‐analysis requirements. The article categorizes use cases 
by domain and highlights performance benchmarks of various 
engines. Importantly, it emphasizes the need for seamless 
integration with machine learning pipelines and support for 
dynamic index updates, both of which are critical for 
managing continuously arriving log streams. This broad 
survey underlines the versatility of vector databases as the 
central component in modern log‐analysis architectures.
