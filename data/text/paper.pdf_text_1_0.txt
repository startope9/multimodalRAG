the query log and passed into a generative transformer to 
predict anomaly likelihood. RAGLog demonstrates significant 
improvements in recall for rare anomaly types by leveraging 
contextual examples, achieving an average recall boost of 
15% on public datasets. The hybrid retrieval‐generation 
paradigm illustrates how vector databases can augment model 
reasoning, though the added retrieval step incurs moderate 
latency overhead. 
In [4], Guo et al. propose LogBERT, adapting the BERT 
architecture to the log‐analysis domain. They introduce a 
specialized masked token prediction objective tailored to log 
syntax and semantics, enabling the model to learn event‐level 
contextual 
representations. 
Once pre-trained on large 
unlabeled log corpora, LogBERT is fine‐tuned for anomaly 
detection by adding a classification head. The authors index 
the 
resulting 
token‐sequence 
embeddings 
using 
an 
approximate nearest‐neighbor (ANN) engine to support 
similarity‐based retrieval for clustering and alerting. Their 
framework achieves a 10% uplift in area under the ROC curve 
compared to LSTM‐based detectors, demonstrating the value 
of deep bidirectional transformers for embedding generation 
in log analysis. 
In [5], Malkov and Yashunin introduce HNSW (Hierarchical 
Navigable Small World) graphs, a breakthrough ANN 
algorithm widely adopted in vector databases. By organizing 
vectors into multiple hierarchical layers connected by
