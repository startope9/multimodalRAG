Clustering for Unsupervised Grouping: DBSCAN or 
HDBSCAN is periodically applied over recent embeddings to 
uncover emerging clusters of semantically related logs (e.g., a 
new error pattern). Cluster centroids can seed new label 
definitions or trigger automatic categorization for operational 
analysts [7]. 
Human-in-the-Loop 
Feedback: 
Flagged 
“UNKNOWN” or low-confidence logs are presented in a 
review UI. Analyst corrections are logged and used to: 
●​
Update the vector database with newly labeled 
vectors. 
●​
Retrain or fine-tune the embedding model to 
incorporate novel semantics. 
●​
Adjust 
category-specific 
similarity 
thresholds 
dynamically based on recent feedback. 
IV.​ RESULTS 
We evaluated our pipeline on a manually curated test set 
comprising 2,500 log entries, all of which were drawn from 
heterogeneous sources to reflect diverse real-world formats. 
The vector store contained 4,000 pre-indexed embeddings in
