Abstractâ€” Log data generated by distributed systems and 
applications contain critical insights for monitoring, debugging, 
and security auditing. Traditional log analysis approaches often 
rely on keyword matching or statistical summaries, which 
struggle 
to 
capture 
the 
semantic 
relationships 
and 
high-dimensional patterns inherent in large-scale, heterogeneous 
logs. In this work, we propose a general framework for log 
analysis that leverages vector databases to encode log entries into 
dense 
embeddings, 
enabling 
efficient 
similarity 
search, 
clustering, and anomaly detection. We first preprocess raw logs 
through tokenization and normalization before transforming 
them into embeddings using a pre-trained language model 
fine-tuned on domain-agnostic log corpora. These embeddings 
are indexed in a vector database optimized for low-latency 
nearest-neighbor queries. We demonstrate how this architecture 
supports real-time detection of anomalous sequences, root-cause 
investigation via semantic clustering, and adaptive alerting 
thresholds. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and public 
benchmark datasets show that our method achieves over 90% 
detection accuracy while reducing query latency by up to 70%
