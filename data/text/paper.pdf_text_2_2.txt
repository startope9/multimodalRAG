managing continuously arriving log streams. This broad 
survey underlines the versatility of vector databases as the 
central component in modern log‐analysis architectures.

All paragraphs must be indented.  All paragraphs must be 
justified, i.e. both left-justified and right-justified. 
A.​ Log Ingestion and Preprocessing 
Source-Agnostic Collection: Logs may originate from 
application servers, network devices, container platforms, or 
cloud services. The ingestion layer exposes RESTful and 
message-queue interfaces (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to 
accommodate both batch and streaming modes. Incoming 
entries—regardless of format (JSON, plain text, CSV)—are 
time-stamped, tagged with origin metadata (host, application, 
severity), and stored in a raw log store (e.g., MongoDB). 
Parsing and Tokenization: To handle heterogeneous 
formats, a unified parser identifies constant fields (e.g., 
timestamps, log levels) and dynamic message bodies. 
Messages are then tokenized using a combination of 
regex-based template matching (to strip variable identifiers) 
and subword tokenizers (e.g., WordPiece) to balance 
vocabulary coverage and generalization [4]. 
Normalization and Enrichment: Normalization steps 
include lowercasing, removal of non-informative tokens 
(timestamps, UUIDs), and standardization of numeric values. 
Enrichment may incorporate geolocation lookups for IP 
addresses, user-agent parsing, or contextual metadata from
