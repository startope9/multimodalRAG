strategies to maintain low‐latency queries at scale. While not 
specific to anomaly detection, the blog provides practical 
guidance on deploying vector databases in production, 
highlighting considerations such as index rebuild scheduling 
and memory footprint management critical for real-time log 
analytics pipelines. 
In [12], a Medium post presents an accessible overview of 
similarity search and vector databases, focusing on the 
mathematical foundations of embedding spaces and ANN 
algorithms. The author walks through embedding generation, 
index ingestion, and query-time tuning parameters like 
efSearch and efConstruction for HNSW indices. Although 
targeted at beginners, the tutorial underscores challenges such 
as 
“curse 
of 
dimensionality” 
and 
suggests 
dimensionality‐reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) to optimize 
both storage and retrieval latency, which directly inform the 
design of log‐analysis systems relying on vector indices. 
In [13], KDnuggets publishes a primer on semantic search 
with vector databases, highlighting use cases in search, 
recommendation, 
and 
anomaly 
detection. 
The article 
compares open‐source vector stores (e.g., FAISS, Annoy) and 
managed cloud offerings, evaluating trade‐offs in throughput, 
latency, and ease of integration. It also showcases code 
snippets for indexing sentence‐transformer embeddings and 
executing k‐NN queries, providing a practical foundation for 
researchers implementing log‐analysis prototypes that require
