neural networks and attention‐based clustering. They propose 
a dual‐encoder architecture where one branch captures 
token‐level semantics and the other encodes event‐sequence 
graphs. The resulting embeddings are concatenated and stored 
in a vector index for hybrid retrieval: token‐similarity and 
graph‐similarity 
searches. 
Benchmarks 
on 
large-scale 
enterprise logs reveal a 12% accuracy improvement over 
single‐encoder 
baselines, 
emphasizing 
the 
merit 
of 
multimodal embedding fusion indexed in vector stores. 
In [11], the MongoDB Blog outlines best practices for 
semantic clustering with vector databases, describing how 
dense embeddings enable grouping similar documents—logs 
included—into coherent clusters. The article discusses index 
configuration, 
distance‐metric 
selection, 
and 
sharding
