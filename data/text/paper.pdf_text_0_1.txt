thresholds. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and public 
benchmark datasets show that our method achieves over 90% 
detection accuracy while reducing query latency by up to 70% 
compared to inverted-index alternatives. Finally, we discuss 
scalability considerations, integration strategies with existing 
observability pipelines, and directions for extending the 
framework to multimodal telemetry analysis.

I.​ INTRODUCTION 
The rapid adoption of distributed architectures, microservices, 
and cloud-native platforms has resulted in a dramatic increase 
in the volume, velocity, and variety of log data, which are 
indispensable for observability, debugging, and security 
analysis [1], [2]. Conventional approaches—rooted in 
keyword searches, regular expressions, or inverted‐index 
mechanisms—often fail to capture the nuanced semantic 
relationships among log entries and cannot scale efficiently 
under real‐time constraints [3]. Meanwhile, advances in 
representation learning have enabled the encoding of textual 
logs into dense vector embeddings that preserve semantic 
similarity in high-dimensional spaces [4], [5]. When paired 
with 
vector 
databases 
optimized 
for 
approximate 
nearest-neighbor 
searches, 
these 
embeddings 
facilitate 
low-latency retrieval, enabling more effective anomaly 
detection,

grouping,
