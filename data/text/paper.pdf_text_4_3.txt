the 
precision–coverage trade-off without manual tuning. Second, 
we 
aim 
to 
extend 
from 
batch 
to 
streaming 
ingestion—integrating Kafka or similar message buses—to 
achieve true near-real-time tagging with sub-100 ms 
end-to-end latency. Third, we will explore model distillation 
and 
lightweight 
transformer 
architectures 
to 
reduce 
summarization inference time and GPU/memory footprints, 
making on-premise and edge-device deployment more 
practical. Fourth, we intend to scale out our vector store in 
OpenSearch by incrementally indexing larger volumes of 
historical and newly arriving logs—leveraging dynamic 
sharding, tiered storage, and optimized retention policies—to 
improve neighbor coverage and retrieval accuracy. Fifth, we 
will formally evaluate clustering quality through silhouette 
and Davies–Bouldin metrics and embed those insights into a 
dynamic dashboard, empowering users to track evolving log 
patterns and emerging anomalies. Finally, by moving toward 
full fine-tuning of our LLM on domain-specific log corpora 
and incorporating multilingual tokenizers, we will strengthen 
semantic understanding across diverse log formats, ensuring
