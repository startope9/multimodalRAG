detectors and a 30% reduction in false positives. The study 
also examines vector‐indexing strategies, advocating for 
in‐memory ANN indexes to balance throughput and resource 
utilization. 
In [7], the authors propose a real‐time, semi‐supervised log 
anomaly detection framework leveraging probabilistic topic 
modeling. They employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to 
discover latent topics across log streams, generating 
topic‐distribution vectors that serve as semantic embeddings. 
These vectors are indexed in a vector database to enable 
efficient 
streaming 
queries 
and 
clustering. 
The 
semi‐supervised component uses a small set of labeled 
anomalies to guide the topic model toward discriminative 
patterns. The system achieves up to 92% detection accuracy 
with minimal labeling effort and supports adaptive retraining 
to accommodate evolving log patterns, highlighting the 
practical 
benefits 
of 
combining 
topic 
models 
with 
vector‐based retrieval. 
In [8], the Ladle method is introduced for unsupervised 
anomaly detection across heterogeneous log types. Ladle 
employs a two‐stage pipeline: first, it normalizes and clusters 
log events into coarse semantic groups using k‐means on raw 
token‐frequency features; second, it refines clusters by 
computing dense embeddings with a lightweight language 
model and indexing them in an ANN structure for 
fine‐grained similarity search. Anomalies are detected as 
events that fail to find sufficiently similar neighbors.
